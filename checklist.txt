Add the business problem at the top for why this is important



Use dimensionality reduction technique after next week class possibly


# ###########################################
# Project Timeline & Pacing

Notebook is due 4/11. 
- Aim for notebook and bulk of work done by 4/4. 
- Bulk of work to do weeks of 3/21 & 3/28


# ###########################################
# Things to do:

- Sam will do dimensionality reduction
- Go through all different model confusion matrices and go from there


- Read about the project online and understand a way to combine soil type features into one feature with a correlation to something else to show coverage


- Think a little about the coverage problem and figure out a way to divide the feature space of ecological and materialogical quantities to align with what trees grow where. Can use context to understand what tress grow better in specific conditions


- Think about scaling the features but do not worry about it right now


- Compact the soil types


- Get a confusion matrix to understand what we are getting confused most with what in our models


- We will find that there a couple of species that get confused with each other a lot

- Create a sequence of classifiers and separate the species we are good at recognizing in the first layer and then focus on separating the similar species in the second layer

- Focus more on the error analysis, less concerned about which model approach
